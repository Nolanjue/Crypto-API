# Crypto-API

Wanted to make a updated crypto price reader with the open api at https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation. 
unfortunately one of the crypto exchanges, binance has a null value for usd change so I wasnt able to include binance here. 

I really like this api, a few things if I were to go back to this would be to improve the css for the design and to add more features.
