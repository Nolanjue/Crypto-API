# Crypto-API

Wanted to make a updated crypto price reader with the open api at https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation. 
unforunately one of the crypto exchanges, binance has a null value for usd change so i wasnt able to include binance here. 

I really liked working with this api and was able to grasp how to more effectively fetch the data.
